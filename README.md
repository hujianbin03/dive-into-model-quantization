# dive-into-model-purning
This is an implementation of model quantization, which includes the quantification of basic concepts, 
symmetric and asymmetric quantization, dynamic range, tensorRT, and PyTorch related quantization.

**Can help you quickly get started with model quantification**

However, it is worth noting that all code does not run in a command-line manner. You can refer to the 
readme in each directory to learn and execute the code.

***
## Prerequisites
- python >= 3.5
- pytorch==2.1.0

You can install required packages by:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
